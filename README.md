## code of my current main gh-page
- with **Context API**
- with custom hook

### some libraries i used:
- [react-icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/)
- [react-router](https://reactrouter.com/)
- [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/)
  - styled-components is great for theming and adapting based on props! made this project so much easier. props can be adapted according to state, for example if I have a state related to the window width, I can trigger certain styles for certain viewports via props

#### This is a project in development: The code needs to be cleaned up and features need to be streamlined. My aim is to create a reusable template for a portfolio page.
